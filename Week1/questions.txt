 1. SPV(simplified payment verification) Nodes : 
  do they store block data?

  what is their use?
  what hazards do they pose?
  sybil attack?
  alert system?(DOS attack?)
  full nodes are gold standard?
Why did Satoshi remain anonymous and did not take profit in Bitcoin?
  maybe because of decentrilization?
